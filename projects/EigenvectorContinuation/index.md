# EigenvectorContinuation [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/409994389.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/409994389)

This code implements the eigenvector continuation (EC) process found in the paper linked below. The program contains a class `EigenvectorContinuer` that runs eignevector continuation for a user-implemented vector class of type `HilbertSpaceAbstract`, along with a few example implementations.

*Abstract:* 
Quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) methods are quantum-classical hybrid methods, commonly used to find ground and excited state energies by projecting the Hamiltonian to a smaller subspace. In applying these, the choice of subspace basis is critical from the perspectives of basis completeness and efficiency of implementation on quantum computers. In this work, we present Eigenvector Continuation (EC) as a QSD method, where low-energy states of the Hamiltonian at different points in parameter space are chosen as the subspace basis. This unique choice enables rapid evaluation of low-energy spectra, including ground and nearby excited states, with minimal hardware effort. As a particular advantage, EC is able to capture the spectrum across ground state crossovers corresponding to different symmetry sectors of the problem. We demonstrate this method for interacting spin models and molecules.

## Contents

#### EigenvectorContinuer class:
Instances of this class run EC for a given hilbert space and set of target points. An instance can:
- calculate the overlap matrix for the current system
- calculate the subspace hamiltonian for the current system
- refresh the overlap matrix property to correspond to the current hilbert space's training points property
- refresh the subspace hamiltonian to match the current target point property
- solve the generalized eigenvalue problem for all the properties of the current instance

#### HilbertSpaceAbstract (HSA) interface/abstract class:
Each implementation (subclass) of this class must include methods that perform the following:
- calculate basis vectors using the space's properties
- define and calculate the behavior of an inner product
- define and calulate the behavior of an expectation value
- calculate the overlap matrix according to the space's properties
- calculate the subspace hamiltonian according to the space's properties and a given full-size hamiltonian
- select which vectors are relevant in performing EC (ground state vs. a selected excited state)
Every implementation must also include an inner class, `HamiltonInitializer`, that constructs a hamiltonian for the system given a target point.

#### NumPyVectorSpace concrete/subclass of HSA:
Has all the functionality required for an HSA, implemented using the NumPy library and using NumPy matrices for representations of all matrices and vectors. Also contains:
- HamiltonianInitializer inner class:
    - provides needed functions for creating hamiltonians using NumPy arrays

#### UnitarySpace concrete/subclass of HSA:
Has all the functionality required for an HSA, implemented using the NumPy library and using NumPy matrices as unitary matrices for representations of all matrices and vectors. Also contains:
- HamiltonianInitializer inner class:
    - provides needed functions for creating hamiltonians using NumPy arrays
Instances of this class also can:
- calculate a unitary for a given vector
- calculate a set of unitaries for the instance's basis vectors

#### methods.py module:
Includes useful methods such as: 
- plot_xxz_spectrum: produces a plot for a given EigenvectorContinuer, a min B_z value, and max B_z value

More details can be found in the **Doucumentation** section below

#### ParamSet tuple:
Convenient tuple to use for calculations throughout the program

## General Notes
### Eigenvector Continuation to perform Quantum Subspace Diagonalization

Finding the ground state energy and preparing the ground state are two important related problems in the domains of physics and chemistry which are hard to solve in general because of the exponential growth of Hilbert space with respect to system size. Eigenvector continuation (EC),  a particular subspace diagonalization method, introduced by Frame et.al., provides a way to address this problem by projecting  the Hamiltonian to a smaller subspace and solving the corresponding smaller generalized eigenvalue problem. In this method,  the Hamiltonian (H') is considered as a function of the system parameter, and low energy states (training states) at a few parameter points (training points) are taken as the basis vectors to span the subspace which serves as a good approximation for ground states (target states) at the desired parameter values (target points). 

This subspace diagonalization can be summarised into the following steps; 

(i) finding the low energy states (training states) {|n>}) to span the subspace 

(ii) computing the overlap matrix (S) and projected subspace Hamiltonian (H);

        H_ij  = <ni|H'_target|nj>,        
        S_ij = <ni|nj>   
(iii) solving the smaller generalized eigenvalue problem to get the target ground state (v) and its energy (E)

    H v = E S v

In our work, we perform step (ii) which requires calculations in the actual bigger Hilbert space using a quantum computer (by employing Hadamard test circuits). Step (i) could also be performed in quantum computers (using methods like VQE, QAOA, etc.). Thus EC can be now performed as a quantum subspace diagonalization method enabling to employ this approach to system sizes much larger than classical computers can handle. 

EC can be applied to any Hamiltonian and the code given here provides a base to employ EC agnostic to any particular representation (e.g, unitary, circuit, etc.). It is abstracted enough to incorporate any method or representation to perform step(i) and step(ii) either classically or using quantum computers without much effort. Step (iii) is solved easily in a classical computer as long as only a reasonable number of training states are used.
 


## Installation
Ensure Python 3.8.0 or higher is installed using
```
    python --version
```

Clone the git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/kemperlab/EigenvectorContinuation
```

Change directories into the newly created repository
```
cd EigenvectorContinuation
```

Run the EigenvectorContinuation setup script
```
python3 setup.py install
```



## Usage
This program is intended to be used on its own or as a supplement to existing programs. This means that one can:

A. run EC straight out of the box using the included implementations of HSA (NumPyVectorSpace and UnitarySpace), and 

B. implement and use a custom implementation of HSA, adhering to the requirements outlined in the HSA interface itself. As long as the implementation is valid, an EigenvectorContinuer will take it as a parameter, and any EC calculations should run seamlessly.

In order to use:
1. Ensure that installation and setup (above) has completed successfully
2. Import relevant modules from this repository and/or from custom implementations into the desired python module/script

*Examples of how to import and use the modules properly are found [in the examples directory](https://github.com/kemperlab/EigenvectorContinuation/tree/main/examples).*
