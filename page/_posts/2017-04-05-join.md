title: Elting Lab / Join
---

The Elting Lab strives for an interdisciplinary, team-based approach to science. We are interested in recruiting trainees with backgrounds in physics, biology, chemistry, and/or engineering.

**We wholeheartedly believe that the more diverse our lab members are - both scientifically and in terms of life experiences - the more we will learn more from each other, and the better our science. Therefore, we welcome lab members regardless of race, religion, gender identification, sexual orientation, age, or disability status.**

# Current openings

<!--We are currently recruiting a full-time research technician. We seek candidates with a degree in a biosciences related field, basic biosciences laboratory skills, and significant experience with molecular biology and microbiology. More details on the position available <a href="https://physics.ncsu.edu/eltinglab/TechnicianFlier2020.pdf">here</a>. Apply <a href="https://jobs.ncsu.edu/postings/137830">here</a>.-->

### Graduate students

The Elting Lab is a highly interedisciplinary environment. Our work touches on topics that include physics, biological sciences, and engineering, and we are potentially open to mentoring students from any of those fields. Students **already admitted to NC State** may send Dr. Elting an email (mary_elting at ncsu dot edu) with a short description of your scientific background, research experience, goals, and interest in the lab. Please include the phrase: "Elting Lab Application" in the subject of your email. We are currently recruiting students to join an interdisciplinary, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/news/CYBORG-cell-grant/">NSF-supported initiative on building synthetic cytoskeletons</a> as well as an <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/news/NIH-MIRA-grant/">NIH-supported project examining the mechanical principles underlying the mitotic spindle</a>.

See the <a href="https://www.physics.ncsu.edu/graduate/">Graduate Programs website</a> for information about applying to the NC State Physics Department.

<!--# Future positions

If you're interested in joining our research efforts in the future, you're welcome to contact Dr. Elting to inquire about possible positions. Please see instructions below.-->

### Undergraduate students

We are currently recruiting undergraduate students for Summer 2022. If interested, please inquire with Dr. Elting (by April 18 to ensure full consideration, although others may be accepted after this date). To do so, send Dr. Elting an email (mary.elting at ncsu dot edu) with a short description of your interest in the lab, research experience (if any), goals, and potential time commitment. Please include the phrase: "Elting Lab Application" in the subject of your email. Students who can commit to full time work in the summer and an average of at least 10 hours per week during the school year will be considered.

### Postdoctoral scholars

We are currently seeking postdoctoral researcher(s) for our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/news/NIH-MIRA-grant/">NIH-supported work</a> examining the mechanics of microtubule bundles in the mitotic spindle. The ideal candidate will have a demonstrated ability to conduct interdisciplinary research at the intersections of biology and physics. To ensure full consideration, applicants should contact us by April 18, but applications will continue to be accepted until the position is filled.

We seek candidates with experimental expertise in cell biology, biochemistry, biophysics, and/or biomolecular engineering. A collaborative, interdisciplinary, and creative mindset is essential. Especially given the highly interdisciplinary nature of our work, we welcome candidates of diverse backgrounds with PhDs in broadly related fields. Members of underrepresented minority groups and women are strongly encouraged to apply. See more details, and info on how to apply, see <a href="https://jobs.ncsu.edu/postings/160832">here</a>.
