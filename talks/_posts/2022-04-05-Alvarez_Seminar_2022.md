## Abstract

I will share some of the progress that has been made at the intersection of quantum computing and condensed matter physics. I’ll briefly tell you what both of those things are and explain why they make for good partners as we try to understand the properties of quantum systems. Our recent work has focused on how to make today’s quantum computers useful for solving problems in condensed matter, which requires some judicious choices of not only method but of problems too. Finally, I will endeavor to convince you that we might actually be able to solve problems on quantum computers sometime in the near future (even without the vaunted error correction).
