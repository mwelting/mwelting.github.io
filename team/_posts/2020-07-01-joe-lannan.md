I graduated magna cum laude in physics from North Carolina State University with a minor in mathematics. During my undergrad I worked in Dr. Dougherty's lab under the Organic and Carbon Electronics Lab (ORaCEL) group where I worked on organic transistors for applications in thin, transparent, and cheaper electronics.

I became interested in biophysics and Dr. Elting's group when taking senior design my final semester of undergrad. In this class I worked on creating a Purcell's swimmer to demonstrate swimming at low Reynold number.

Currently I am working on creating magnetic tweezers for control and manipulation of cells in the Cyborg Cells project.
