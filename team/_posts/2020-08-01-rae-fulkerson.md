My love of science stems from my insatiable craving for knowledge. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Molecular and Cellular Biology in Spring of 2019 and was overjoyed to join the Elting lab the following Fall as a Lab Technician. I never imagined myself in the Physics department, but have always had an interest in the intersection of Biology and Physical science. I hope to add a different perspective with my background in order to better support the goals of the lab. Outside of the lab I enjoy playing games, making art, reading, seeing live music, and snuggling with my cats.
