I received my Bachelor's in chemistry with a minor in biology at Appalachian State University in Boone, NC. Afterwards I moved to Raleigh to work in Newborn Screening at the North Carolina State Laboratory Of Public Health. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Microbial Biotechnology at NC State and working as a technician in the Elting lab. My research uses cell and molecular biology cloning techniques to perform plasmid design and assembly. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, trying new restaurants, and hanging out with my greyhound and cat.
