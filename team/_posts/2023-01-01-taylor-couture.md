I graduted Magna Cum Laude from the University of New Hampshire with my major in physics. While there, I worked in Dr. Slifer's lab which studied nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and nuclear polarization targets. I became interested in biophysics after taking a condensed matter physics elective and found the connection between physics and biology fascinating.

I am currently studying the dynamics and working to characterize the cross-linker protein Ase1 in the fission yeast S.Pombe.
