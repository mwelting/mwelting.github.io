My name is Christian Pagán-Medina and was born and raised in Puerto Rico. My desire is to
create a surrounding environment of comprehension and a feeling that we can always learn new things. That includes me. A summary of my experience includes my master’s degree volunteer research which covered the use of essential oils to control fungi growth in citrus fruits. I have experience with fermentation of pickles while working with the USDA, in a BSL-1 and BSL-2, laboratory with bacteria such as Lactobacillus, Enterobacter, and E. coli. Some correlating work included the use of molecular biology techniques to study the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of lactobacillus to understand their process in fermentation.
